Git and GitHub are powerful tools for collaborative and individual projects. Git is a version control software that aids with tracking changes made to a set of files over time. GitHub is a web-based platform for storing and sharing project files online. This session begins with a conceptual overview of both tools, including an introduction to fundamental concepts such as version control and practical applications like developing a syllabus or collaborative writing. This session then covers initializing Git repositories, committing changes, pushing to GitHub, cloning repositories to your local machine, and forking repositories from other accounts on GitHub.

In this workshop, you will:

- Learn what Git, GitHub and Markdown are, how do they differ, and how they can be integrated to support your scholarly work
- Learn what version control is and why it can be useful
- Review basic Command line functions
- Install and configure Git on your local machine (`git--version`, `git--config`)
- Practice using basic markdown by creating a syllabus using a plain text editor (including headers, lists, bold, and emphasis)
- Stage and commit changes using Git (`git status`, `git add`, `git commit -m`, and `git log`)
- Pushing a repository with Git and files to GitHub (`git push origin master`)
- Cloning an existing repository from GitHub to your local machine so you can work with it (`git clone`)
