## Projects or Challenges to Try

- Fill in your syllabus repository further, adding not only to your syllabus.md file, but adding additional content such as assignments and create a website from it using GitHub Pages or Jekyll.
- Use Markdown and plain text editors to write up an assignment for your students. Use Pandoc to convert the file to Word and PDF.
