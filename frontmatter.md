## Abstract

Git is version control software used to track the state of files associated with a project. Users can take snapshots of files, travel through the history of a project, collaborate transparently with others, and easily keep compatible data in many locations. Combined with GitHub, a cloud service, Git also becomes a way of finding and publishing text, including writing and code.

In this session, we'll learn what makes Git such a powerful tool for both collaborative and individual projects. We will share a conceptual overview of Git and GitHub, explore fundamental concepts such as committing and pushing, and explore practical applications of GitHub for writing and coding. This session will show how to use Git and GitHub for a variety of digital undertakings, including collaborating with others, finding code for use in your projects, and sharing your work publicly. This session covers initializing Git repositories, committing changes, pushing to GitHub, and cloning repositories to your local machine.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn what Git, GitHub and Markdown are, how do they differ, and how they can be integrated to support your scholarly work.
- Learn what version control is and why it can be useful
- Review basic Command line functions 
- Install and configure Git on your local machine - ('git--version'), ('git--config')
- Practice using basic Markdown by Creating a Syllabus using a plain text editor (including headers, lists, bold, and emphasize)
- Stage and committ changes using Git - ('git status'), ('git add'), ('git commit -m'), and ('git log')
- Pushing repo with Git and files to GitHub ('git push origin master')
- Cloning an existing repo on GitHub to your local machine so you can work with it - ('git clone')

## Estimated time

Forthcoming.

## Prerequisites

- Intro to Command Line

### Projects that use these skills

- [GCDI's digital research institute](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum) has been improved and built out over time using GitHub to store and track multiple projects that use the same base of repositories, and new versions.
- F-ing Algorithm project uses Git and GitHub to create multiple versions of their project in different languages - ([Chinese](https://github.com/labuladong/fucking-algorithm) and [English](https://github.com/labuladong/fucking-algorithm/tree/english)), and to create a [GitBook](https://labuladong.gitbook.io/algo-en/i.-dynamic-programming/analysisofdynamicprogramming) for sharing their work. 
- Here are two examples of using Git and GitHub for teaching - [a syllabus using a GitHub repo](https://github.com/quinnanya/dlcl204) and [a syllabus using a repo and GitPages](https://digitalhistory.github.io/).
- [Fake New Corpus](https://github.com/several27/FakeNewsCorpus), an open source dataset composed of millions of news articles mainly intended for use in training deep learning algorithms for purpose of fake news recognition. The dataset is still work in progress and for now, the public version includes only 9,408,908 articles.
- [C+=](https://github.com/TheFeministSoftwareFoundation/C-plus-Equality), a feminist programming language, created by The Feminist Software Foundation to smash the toxic Patriarchy that is inherent in and that permeates all current computer programming languages.
- [Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet), an open-source Javascript library for building mobile-friendly interactive maps.

### Ethical Considerations

- Within the nebulous open-source ecosystem, GitHub is an important place for storing and finding code. What if your open source code was used by an entity or for a purpose that did not agree with your ethics? For example, the platform received backlash from employees of GitHub and users of the platform when it was revealed that they held a contract with ICE. In this case, neither group wanted their code shared and used by ICE in detaining and deporting immigrants.
