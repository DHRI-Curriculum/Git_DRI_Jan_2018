# 1. What are Git, GitHub and Markdown?

**Git** is software used for version control—that is, tracking the state of files and changes you make to them over time. Git can be enabled in a folder, and then used to save the state of the contents in that folder at different points in the future, as designated by you. In the language of Git, a folder is called a _repository_. In the context of this workshop, it refers to a folder that is being tracked by Git. Using Git, you can view a log of the changes you've made to the files in a repository and compare changes over time. You can also revert back to previous versions, and create "branches" of a project to explore different futures. Git is also useful for collaboration, as a repository can be shared across computers, and its contents can be asynchonously developed and eventually merged with the main project.

**GitHub** is a online platform for hosting Git repositories. It functions for some, predominantly programmers, as a social network for sharing and collaborating on code-based projects. Users can share their own projects, as well as search for others, which they can then often work on and contribute to. Digital Humanists, librarians, and other academics are also finding ways Git and GitHub are useful in writing projects and teaching. GitHub also serves as a web-hosting platform, allowing users to create websites from their repositories.

**Markdown** is a markup language for formatting text. Like HTML, you add markers to plain text to style and organize the text of a document.

In HTML:

```html
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
```

In Markdown:

```markdown
# Heading 1
```

Whereas you use HTML and CSS with WordPress, you use Markdown to render legible documents on GitHub. Markdown has fewer options for marking text than HTML. It was designed to be easier to write and edit.

The lessons of this workshop were originally written in markdown. You can see [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git/v2.0/lessons.md) what they look like in their raw, unrendered form.

Compare that with this—the source code for this lesson's web page, written in HTML [here](view-source:http://curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/workshops/git/lessons/).

Markdown is also arguably more sustainable and accessible than formats like `.docx` because of its simplicity and related ability to be read across multiple platforms. Use of Markdown is also supported by document-conversion tools like [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) that can change a markdown file to an `.epub` with one command entered into your terminal.

## Highlighting Distinctions

As we move forward its important to make sure we're firm on the distinctions between the three different tools outlined above.

**Git** is a software that you use on your laptop, or your local computer/machine. The repository with your project's files is stored on your hard drive. You also edit the text files on your local machine using a plain text editor, which is another software on your local computer like Visual Studio Code.

**GitHub** is a cloud-based platform that you access through your internet browser. Even though you physically are still in the same place, working on your laptop, you are no longer working on your local machine, you are on the Internet. This is a fundamentally different location than when you're working with your Git repository and editing and creating files in your plain text editor. With GitHub, you are uploading your repository—as described above—from your local machine to this platform on the Internet to be shared more broadly. You can also create private repositories if you want to use GitHub to backup a project.

**Markdown** is the language used to render plain text files in your Git-enabled repository with markup on GitHub. When you view your file on the platform, `# headers` are rendered as HTML-formatted headers, links are inserted, etc.
