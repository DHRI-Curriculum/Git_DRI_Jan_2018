# What are Git, GitHub and Markdown?

## What is Git? 

**Git** is software used for version control—that is, tracking the state of files. Git can be enabled in a folder, and then used to save the state of the contents in that folder at different points in the future designated by you. In the language of Git, a folder is called a *repository*; in the context of this workshop, it refers to anfolder that is being tracked by Git. Using Git, you can view a log of the changes you've made to the files in a repository and compare changes over time. You can also revert back to previous versions, and create branches of a projects to explore different futures. Git is also useful for collaboration, as a repository can be shared across computers, and its contents can be asynchonously developed and eventually, and maybe partially merged with the main project. 

## What is GitHub?

**GitHub** is a online platform for hosting Git repositories.It functions for some, predominantly programmers, as a social network for sharing and collaborating on code-based projects. Users can share their own projects, as well as search for others, which they could then also work on and contribute to in many instances. Digital Humanists, Librarians, and other academics are also finding ways Git and GitHub are useful in writing projects and teaching. GitHub also serves as a web-hosting platform, allowing users to create websites from their repositories.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a markup language for formatting text. Like HTML, you add markers to plain text to style and organize the text of a document.

```
In HTML: 
<h1> Heading 1 </h1>

In Markdown
# Heading 1
```

Whereas you use HTML and CSS with WordPress, you use Markdown with GitHub. Markdown has fewer options for marking text than HTML. It was designed to be human-readable, meaning easy to write and edit. 

You'll notice this file is written in markdown—[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git/master/sections/concept.md) is what it looks like in its raw, unrendered form.

Compare that with this, showing the source code for the GitHub page, written in HTML: view-source:https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git

It's also arguably more sustainable and accessible than formats like `.docx` because of its simplicity and related ability to be read across multiple platforms. Use is also supported by document-conversion tools like [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) that can change a markdown file to an epub with one command entered into your terminal.
